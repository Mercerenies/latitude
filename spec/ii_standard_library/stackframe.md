# The Stack Frame Object

    StackFrame := Object clone.

A `StackFrame` object is generated by the VM when
an [`Exception`](exception.md) object is thrown or when
`currentStackTrace` [TODO: Link] is called. The `StackFrame` object,
as the name suggests, carries information about a single frame of the
call stack, as well as a reference to the calling frame. These
references are stored in the `StackFrame` object's inheritance
hierarchy, so a `StackFrame`'s parent object *is* the calling object's
`StackFrame`.

## Simple Slots

    StackFrame toString := "StackFrame".

## Methods

### `StackFrame file.`

Returns the name of the file from which this stack frame originated.

### `StackFrame line.`

Returns the line number in the file from which this stack frame
originated.

### `StackFrame dumpObject.`

This method overrides `Object dumpObject`, to print the individual
stack frames in a concise way. If the original `dumpObject` behavior
is desired, use `stdout dump: StackFrame`.
