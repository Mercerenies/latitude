# The Kernel Object

    Kernel

The kernel object defines several language-level operators and
reflection functions, as well as replicating some of the behavior in
the root object so that it can be applied to non-traditional objects
as well.

## Simple Slots

    Kernel toString := "Kernel".

## Methods

### `Kernel kill.`

This method performs a hard kill of the interpreter, immediately
terminating the program.
