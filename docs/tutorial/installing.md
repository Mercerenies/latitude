# Installation

The official Latitude virtual machine is supported on POSIX-compliant
machines and on recent versions of Windows.

## For POSIX-Compliant Operating Systems

Run the following command, from the base directory.

    $ make release

Building the `release` target is recommended for maximal performance.
In order to set Latitude up so that you can run it from the command
line, run

    $ sudo make install

If you do not have `sudo` or do not wish to install Latitude to
`/usr/local/bin`, you may add the base project directory to your
`PATH` environment variable manually
