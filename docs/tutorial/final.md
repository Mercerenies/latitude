# Closing Thoughts

You now have all of the basic tools necessary to write Latitude
programs.

For your convenience, there are several heavily-documented Latitude
example programs available
at
[/Mercerenies/latitude-examples/](https://github.com/Mercerenies/latitude-examples).
Feel free to submit any bugs, suggestions, or ideas through the
official Latitude issue tracker, and Latitude is always open to
contributions from outside sources, so feel free to fork the
repository and make your own improvements as well.
